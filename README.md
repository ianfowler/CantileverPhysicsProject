Cantilever for Calc Based Mechanics, Ian & Freddie

This is the result of the simulation with all the blocks, with the center of mass moving progressively closer to the edge of the table:

These are the given instructions for how to build it. One label column tells us which block too use, and the shift column tells us how much space from the last block we should place the new block.
